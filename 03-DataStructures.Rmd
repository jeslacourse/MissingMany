# Building Derived Elements [SQL]

The derived elements are build in SQL using a series of case statements. 

```
anyAABlack = 
  CASE WHEN 
	          (ETHNIC_CODE in ('1') --PRIMARY
	            OR SUBSTRING(RACE_ETHNICITY,15,1) LIKE '%Y%') THEN 1 
       ELSE 0
		   END
```

Each statement checks both the MIS/IPEDS `ETHNIC_CODE` and the 21-code `RACE_ETHNICITY` for the given criteria. The full coding can be found here: [SQL Coding - ETHNICITY TABLE]
