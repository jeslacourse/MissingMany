Sierra College reported more than six times as many American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) students excluded from Fall 2023 MIS reporting than those included. Of 709 students with AI/AN ancestry, only 94 were reported to MIS as AI/AN. 

AI/AN students who reported any Hispanic/Latinx or multiracial ancestry on their CCC application are not included in state and federal reporting as AI/AN students. That said, it's critical that institutions include these students into on-site analytics and demographics, even if these students are not identified at a state or federal level.
